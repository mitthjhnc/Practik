    '''
    Function for determining a datetype. We are operating with 2 datetypes,
    0, which is a workday and 1, which is a holiday or a weekend. We consider
    the days between Christmas and New Year as holidays, as we do with the
    day after Ascension day.

    Parameters
    ----------
    date : dt.date
        The date to evaluate.

    Returns
    -------
    date_type : int
        The type of day the date is. Either 1 for normal workday, and 2
        for weekends and holidays.
